# d3samples...
NEW! A look at my work in d3...

so picking up steam on my d3 adventure...
it's a single js file stepping back in time from where I am to where I started...

goals:
• interactive visualizations (animated, dynamic styles, transitions)
• multiple datasets (merging generated graphics from multiple files)
• 3D visualizations (surfaces, spaces)
• remote data (ajax/json, apis, websockets)
•
