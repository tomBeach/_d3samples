A look at my work in d3...


picking up steam on my d3 adventure


it's a single js file 

stepping back in time 

from where I am to 

where I started


goals:

  • interactive visualizations (animated, dynamic styles, transitions)


  • multiple datasets (merging generated graphics from multiple files)


  • 3D visualizations (surfaces, spaces)


  • remote data (ajax/json, apis, websockets)


  • visual design...  


      this is the area I am most intrigued by and eager to explore... 
  
  
      mapping data from our world environment and using images to convey meaning
  
  
      from doTheMath to seeTheMath...
  
  
      relativity...  seeing social/political/economic issues within their contexts...
  
  
      interactivity... how can the ability to manipulate data in real-time help understanding?
